## Before You Read

STATS 601 is a PhD-level course covering a broad array of statistical learning methods, with a particular focus on dimension reduction, classification, and clustering methods.

These notes collect both lecture material from Professor [Kean Ming Tan](http://www.keanmingtan.com/) and lab sessions with GSI [Kihyuk Hong](https://kihyukh.github.io/).  They are written by Ziheng Wei, a first-year Master of Applied Statistics student at UMich.  

I hope they help even one student or any enthusiast of theoretical ML master the course. Please report any typos or suggestions to `zihwei@umich.edu`.

## Course Overview

1. **Review of multivariate Normal Distribution**  
2. **Dimension reduction**  
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Factor Analysis
   - E-M Algorithm
   - Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
   - Kernel PCA
3. **Classification**  
   - Classification (LDA, QDA, naive Bayes, SVM, ...)
   - Tree methods (CART, Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting, AdaBoost, ...)
   - Neural Network
4. **Clustering**  
   - Data-driven methods (K-means, Hierarchical clustering, ...)
   - Model-based methods (Finite mixture model, ...)
